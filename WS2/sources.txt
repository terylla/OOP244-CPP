I got help from JiHee Kim for this part in Subject.cpp - int report(const Subject& Sub) through email because we couldn't communicate in class:



				cout << Sub.m_noOfStdsInSecs[i];
				total = total + Sub.m_noOfStdsInSecs[i];
				if (i < *Sub.m_noOfSections - 1) {
					cout << ",";
				}
				else cout << endl;
			


I was having trouble with pointer and address
